    "A Computational Model to Visualize the Effects of Added Influx of Fresh Melt-Water from the Greenland Ice Sheet on the North Atlantic Ocean Waters\n",
    "\n",
    "Intro:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will attempt to build a simple computational model, using the tools learned in this course, that aims to visualize a couple of climatic variables. Firstly, I will calculate the differential between the Greenland Sheet's newly forming ice versus the yearly mass loss due to melting. For this, I will use a loop styled function that will calculate the net ice loss over time. Secondly, I will use the results of the first model to inform a second model that takes into account the amount of surplus fresh waters added to the salty North Atlantic waters in order to visualize the potential changes to the ocean composition over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "            The Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing ice at an increasing rate in recent decades. According to NASA and other climate studies:\n",
    "            In 2019, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost around 280 gigatons of ice per year on average (source: NASA).\n",
    "            The melting rate is expected to increase over time due to rising global temperatures, which cause more melt during the summer months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accumulation Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "            The accumulation rate refers to how much snow and ice are added to the Greenland Ice Sheet annually. \n",
    "            This varies with seasonal precipitation, but the average rate has been around:\n",
    "            150â€“200 gigatons per year in recent decades (source: NASA, IPCC reports).\n"

    "#### This simple model does show that the North Atlantic waters will likely experience a significant change in its water density range as fresher meltwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet is deposited in the ocean over time. This has important implications for the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic ocean which feeds the overall circulation and recycling of ocean waters around the world, namely through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)\n",

For example, it may turn out that the influx of fresh meltwater has a larger or lower effect on ocean salinity. I tried to use conservative values based on a couple of academic papers on the topic but I am no expert on the matter. "
